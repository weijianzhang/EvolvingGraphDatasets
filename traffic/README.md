# Highways Agency network journey time and traffic flow data

* DATA.GOV.UK

* Description: 

This data series provides average journey time, speed and traffic flow
information for 15-minute periods since April 2009 on all morotways
and 'A' roads managed by the Highways Agency, known as the Strategic
Road Network, in England.

Journey times and speeds are estimated using a combination of sources,
including Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras,
in-vehicle Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and inductive loops built
into the road surface.

Please note that journey times are derived from real vehicle
observations and imputed using adjacent time periods or the same time
period on different days. Further information is available in 'Field
Descriptions' at the bottom of this page.
